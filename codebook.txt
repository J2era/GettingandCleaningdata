In this experiment, a group of thirty volunteers performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone  on their waists.

Three-axial linear acceleration and three-axial angular velocity were collected.The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were filtered to remove noise. The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ).The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to get Jerk signals(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to indicate 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions: tBodyAcc-XYZ, tGravityAcc-XYZ,tBodyAccJerk-XYZ


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


Average of each variable was calculated for each activity and each subject.
